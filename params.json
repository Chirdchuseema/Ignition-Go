Ignition Go will include a web-based generator.\r\n\r\n### Coming soon (alpha in February 2016), contact us to help build the most amazing web app builder ever!  \r\nPlease contact me to help, I'm hoping to build a team of master \"Blox Ignitians\".\r\nPlanned example \"blox\" include bulk emailer, dashboard, report manager, and many more!!!  \r\n\r\n### Server Requirements (Preferred)\r\n\r\n* **PHP 5.5+** (mainly for [password_hash()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php) and [password_verify()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php) functions as used in this project); and also the usage of [shortcut syntax](http://php.net/manual/en/migration54.new-features.php) in this project needs  **5.4+** and above.\r\n* **Apache 2.2+** with rewrite mod enabled\r\n* **MySQL 5.5+**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nIgnition Go will be a jumpstart for rapid development:\r\n* Multi-faceted (e.g. Frontend Website, Admin Panel, and API) website in a single application\r\n* Modular design using CodeIgniter HMVC extension\r\n* Custom config files (sites.php, locale.php) for easy configuration of website behavior\r\n* Admin Panel with AdminLTE v2 theme\r\n* Includes usage of [Sortable](http://rubaxa.github.io/Sortable/) library and many other 3rd party optional libraries\r\n* API Site to handle RESTful endpoints\r\n* User authentication (optional) for Frontend Website (Sign Up, Login, Forgot Password, et al)\r\n* User authentication for Admin Panel (Login, Change Password, et al)\r\n* Preset layouts and templates\r\n* Preset asset pipeline (e.g. minify scripts, image optimization) via Gulp (reference from [gulp-starter 2.0 branch](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter/tree/2.0))\r\n* Buildablox blox and form builder to generate blox and CRUD form views with Bootstrap theme, form validation\r\n* Breadcrumb and Pagination handling\r\n* Multilingual support\r\n* Email config setup\r\n* CLI utility functions (e.g. cron job, database backup)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Folder Structure\r\n\r\nPlanned folder structure (not all folders shown).\r\n\r\n```\r\napplication/                    --- Main application (CodeIgniter) source folder\r\n    config/                     --- Config files\r\n        production/             --- Override Configuration when ENVIRONMENT is set as \"production\"\r\n    controllers/                --- Controllers for Frontend Website;

It utilizes package and component tools from these sites:\r\n* NPM [node.js](http://nodejs.org/): package manager for node modules\r\n* Bower [bower](http://bower.io/): manager for bower components \r\n* GulpJS [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): task runner to compile, combine, and minify\r\n","google":"UA-72523283-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
